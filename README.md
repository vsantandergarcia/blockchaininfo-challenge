# blockchaininfo-challenge
Create an Android application that will fetch information about the current Bitcoin market price (suggested resources will be provided below, however you may decide to use another) and display the data in a graph of your choosing.

The application must:

make a network call to a remote api resource to fetch the current exchange rate data, it is not necessary to demonstrate authentication or oauth processes,

effectively make use of threading and asynchronous behaviour,

show understanding of the Android SDK and application / activity lifecycles,

be performant and make appropriate use of background tasks,

show market price data over time using an appropriate graph.

Please develop the application in a way that demonstrates your knowledge of testable clean code, clean architecture, reactive and “SOLID” design principles.
